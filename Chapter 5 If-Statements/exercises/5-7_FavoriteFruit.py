#Exercise 5-7 Favorite Fruit
#Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
fruits = ['apple', 'orange','banana','peach','strawberry','raspberry']

#Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. 

if 'apple' in fruits:
    print("You really like apples!")
if 'orange' in fruits:
    print("You really like oranges!")
if 'banana' in fruits:
    print("You really like bananas!")
if 'peach' in fruits:
    print("You really like peaches!")
if  'strawberry' in fruits:
    print("You really like strawberries!")
if 'raspberry' in fruits:
    print("You really like raspberries!")
#if the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, such as "You really like bananas!"
