#More Loops
# All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using for loops when printing, to save space.
# Choose a version of foods.py and write two for loops to print each list of foods
foods = ['pizza','pasta','cereal','french toast']

for food in foods: 
    print(food.title())

accessories = ['siccor','eraser','pencil','ruler','stop watch', 'computer']

for tool in accessories:
    print(tool.title())
