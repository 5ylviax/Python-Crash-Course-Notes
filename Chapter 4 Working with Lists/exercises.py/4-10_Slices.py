#exercise 4-10 slices 
#Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several lines to the end of the program that do the following: 
games = ['deadlock', 'apex legends', 'fortnite', 'valorant']

#print the message The first three items in the list. Then use a slice to print the first three items from that program's list.
print(games[:3])
#print the message Three items from the middle of the list are. Then use a slice to print three items from the middle of the list.
print(games[1:])
#print the message The last three items in the list are. Then use a slice to print the last three items in the list.
print(games[-3:])
