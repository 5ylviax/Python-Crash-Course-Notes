#----------------------------------------------------Indenting Unnecessarily-------------------------------------------------------
#if you accidentally indent a line that does not need to be indented, Python informs you about the unexpected indent.
message = "Hello Python world!"
print(message)
# print call does not need to indented because it is not part of a loop 
# Therefore, Python reports that error
